A controversial subject. I recall that someone wrote on k4@listbox that Arthur says if k is
poetry then q is prose. I also know that code is often read under stress, in a variety of
fonts, by those who are not necessarily experts in the language, nor even proficient in
the application.

Consequently I prefer to write q as (English) prose:

	, ; : ::		have no leading space and a single trailing space
	
	( [				have one leading space and no trailing space
	
	) ]				have no leading space and one trailing space
	
	+ - * %	$ !		and other single character operators have a leading and trailing space
